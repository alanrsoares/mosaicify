    <div class="col c4">
      <h3>100% Flux</h3>
      <p>A true flux compliant library in a very small size. Actions are fire and forget, stores have no setters, you get constants, and Flux's single dispatcher.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col c4">
      <h3>Server Side Rendering</h3>
      <p>Alt comes with support for building Isomorphic JavaScript applications right out of the box.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col c4">
      <h3>Snapshots</h3>
      <p>At any point in time you can take a snapshot of the entire application state and then reload it later. This opens the door for easier debugging, hot state reloading, and more.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col c4">
      <h3>Terse</h3>
      <p>Do away with defining constants, building your own boilerplate dispatchers, and ugly switch statements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col c4">
      <h3>Flexible</h3>
      <p>Feel like ditching singletons, creating instances of each store, and passing them to your view? No problem.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col c4">
      <h3>Forward Thinking</h3>
      <p>Although optional, Alt is meant to work with ES2015 leveraging the new constructs and syntax for something powerful.</p>
